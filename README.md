# Cobalt CSS

========

Cobalt CSS is a really small CSS toolkit to serve as a base for your own projects. It will also serve as the basis for an upcoming application.

It is written with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and the .scss files are included so you can freely modify them. Please be aware this is very much an early version though, so apologies for any bugs that have found their way in!
